# Finding the diameter in a data-tree
## What is a diameter in data tree?
The longest distance possible in a data tree.
Or more precisely but less straight-foward: The longest of all the shortest path between two nodes in a data tree.
Just like the diameter in a circle, the shortest distance(straight line) between two oppsite side is the longest straight line possible in a circle.
## Properties
Let's denote y=d(x) as "the further node from x is y"

If node a,b forms a diameter,
